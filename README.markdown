TOPdesk Go - MasterClass 2012
=============================

The flaming wrecking ball of awesomeness that is the code in this repository is the result of the 2012 development MasterClass in TOPdesk.

Project description
-------------------

The game of go has been an inspiration to countless of wizened men with worsening eyesight for many a year and now it's time for the game
to move into the digital age. There is going to be trouble, there is going to be danger, but this brave team of dare-devils is not afraid to tackle anything!

[bring in the testers]

You are welcome to have fun with the game as it's being built just over your head. We need your input to make it as awesome as can be! Compete with our advanced AI and tell us everything that's wrong! We will probably deride you and laugh in your face, but you will have made no change at all in the project? Or will you?...

### The team ###

Each and every one of them superior specimens of man, the brave hearts that make up this year's MasterClass all bring something unique to the table.

#### Bernd "Wicked Hound" Junglen ####
Hailing from the lushious wilds of the Bavarian forests, Bernd has come to Delft to push the masterclass beyond the end of the world. Having a solid working knowledge of the internet and its Wicket (tm) ways Bernd has come growling out of his comfort zone to lead us all into the first sprint.

#### Bart "Wrecking Orca" Enkelaar ####
Being raised in a background of solid North Sea realism has never been able to get into the way of Bart's endless optimism and naivity. Flipping a water-splashed 180 for this project, Bart has come in to tear down the walls before their even built.

#### Jorn "Cursing Grizzly" Hertsig ####
Bizar as Jorn's usual state may be, for the masterclass 2012 he's got his claws out. If you've got a problem and you think noone else can help you, have no fear, Jorn is here.

#### Krisztian "Persistent Crow" Horvath ####
In the distant lands of Magyarország, Krisztian was raised 

#### Lorant "Boxing Bulldog" Pinter ####
